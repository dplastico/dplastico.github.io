# PACKED BINARIES (And how to unpack them)

Hello all! I'm writing this post for learning purposes, as research about the topic on the title. The main idea is to better understand how the packing mechanism works, to have a better understanding  of the techniques and ways to apply this, with a special focusing on malware development and analysis, and how today's malware executables try to hide from different detection systems.

That's why, in my style, I think that before starting to look for unpacking mechanisms or similar resources, we first need to understand how an actual binary is formed, what is the structure of itself and how a "packer" will use this information to create a "packed" executable.

We will need to identify the sections that we want to read or modify if necessary when packing executables and also this will provide good information if we are performing any Reverse Engineering work specially in modified binaries or malware samples that try to "hide" information on the binary itself. (this would be the main goal behind it, how can malicious code can hide from Reverse Engineering)

I will try to not approach the "packing" process as a compression mechanism (which is very popular also) but rather than that. We will try to focus on learning how a packer works and then, try to pack malicious code into a file. Also, we can then work on unpacking techniques with some malware samples to see if we can apply this knowledge.

As a disclaimer, I assume that the reader is familiar with programming concepts and have some Windows Internal and assembly knowledge, not expert level, but at least be able to understand instructions and code flow.

With that said, Lets get it!

## Which tools or programs I will use for this post:

- CFF Explorer https://ntcore.com/?page_id=388
- gcc for Windows (MinGW) https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/Installer/mingw-get-setup.exe/download
- UPX for Windows  https://upx.github.io/
- x32dbg https://x64dbg.com/
- IDA (free version) https://hex-rays.com/ida-free/
- Any Text Editor

# Executable files and the PE Format
*https://docs.fileformat.com/executable/exe/*

Before starts analyzing and modifying executables, we need to answer the question: **What is an executable File?**

An executable file is referred in general as a file that will cause a computer to perform tasks according to instructions on the referred file. In Windows OS, popular extensions for executable files are .BAT, .EXE, .DLL, .COM, etc.

The word EXE is a short for executable by default a Windows OS will try to "execute" all files with this extension. (invoked from command line, or double click on the gui). We will focus on this extension for practical reasons. For that We can Write a small program in C, we will called hello.c and we can open our text editor and code it as follow:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(){
    puts("AAAA Hello");
    return 0;
}
```

Following is the command to compile it:

```bash

gcc hello.c -fno-pie -o a.exe

```

We can now test our binary it should print to stdout the string "AAAA hello", the idea behind the "AAAA" is just to easily identify the string in memory if we need to

Great, so we have a binary and we want to "pack" it, so before manipulating the binary, lets better understand how it is constructed, and we can investigate this, since in Windows executables follow the **PE format**, a file format for executables files. Let's take a look at it.

## What is the  PE format? 
*https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/debug/pe-format*

PE stands for **Portable Executable** and it is a format file for executables, DLLs, and other binaries that are executed under Windows systems on x64 and x86 architectures. The PE format is a Data Structure  that contains information necessary for the OS to load and execute the binary. This can include the **IAT** (Import Address Table) and the **TLS** (Thread Local Storage) The PE format is a successor of the previous format used on Windows NT systems called **COFF** (Common Object File Format) which is present still on the structures as a table.

# The PE Format: 

A typical PE format will have the following structure on file:

![](https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/112015_2323_2MalwareRes1.jpg)


*https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/*


The diagram above represents the PE Structure. And as Its highlighted, we can observe 2 main subdivisions: **The headers** and **The Section(s)** and also he's different components. In order to better understand it it's necessary to describe each of this in detail

### **A note on RVA or Relative Virtual Address**

Before starting digging into the headers, It's necessary to clear the dust in some concepts.

RVA or **Relative Virtual Address** is a value which represents the offset to the image base that corresponds to the **Virtual Address** of that specific Address. in an example:

```python
VA = RVA + BaseImage
```
This concept will help us to determine the location of different functions and sections in the binary. The base image can be the preferred one if no **ASLR** (Address Space Layout Randomization) is enabled, otherwise it can be randomized so this can change the Virtual Address value in every load of the binary, in our case we will compile the binaries with no ASLR, just for making easy to focus on the concepts and not on bypassing randomization, but this is important to keep in mind. 

As an example let's use the information in CFF explorer to test this.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dplastico/dplastico.github.io/main/_posts/img/2022-03-27-13-10-38.png)

You can see that the RVA of the .text section holds the 0x1000 value this means that the .text section shold load at BaseImage + 0x1000, we will inspect the preferred BaseImage of this binary later on, but is set to 0x400000, sothe address should load at 0x401000, let's open this on x32dbg and lets see if we can spot where the .text section was loaded, we can check this opening the executable on the debugger and go to view->Memory map

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dplastico/dplastico.github.io/main/_posts/img/2022-03-27-13-15-09.png)

Listed above our calculations are correct, we can use this to refer to execution and this will be important when we will start going deeper into the binary it self

### DOS HEADER
*https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/msdn-magazine/2002/february/inside-windows-win32-portable-executable-file-format-in-detail*

The **DOS_HEADER**, is the first piece of every PE executable, is not important to the functionality of current programs but is  present for legacy compatibility. The **DOS_HEADER** structure is 64 bytes long and the main purpose of the header is to make the file be able to execute under MS-DOS

```c++
typedef struct _IMAGE_DOS_HEADER
{
     WORD e_magic;
     WORD e_cblp;
     WORD e_cp;
     WORD e_crlc;
     WORD e_cparhdr;
     WORD e_minalloc;
     WORD e_maxalloc;
     WORD e_ss;
     WORD e_sp;
     WORD e_csum;
     WORD e_ip;
     WORD e_cs;
     WORD e_lfarlc;
     WORD e_ovno;
     WORD e_res[4];
     WORD e_oemid;
     WORD e_oeminfo;
     WORD e_res2[10];
     LONG e_lfanew;
} IMAGE_DOS_HEADER, *PIMAGE_DOS_HEADER;
```

Above  we can see how the **DOS_HEADER** is structured in different fields with different sizes. This field contains information about the program and also about other structures in the PE. As an example, and something that can be useful to identify the start of a PE executable,  we can take a look at the value of the **e_magic** field. This field always Starts with a magic value of **0x45DA** which can be represented in ASCII as **"MZ"** This is a reference to  Marz Zbikowski who was the designer of MS-DOS executable format. Let's check this in CFF explorer, this tool have very nice interface to inspect the sections and structures and also, you see the Hex representation of the binary

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dplastico/dplastico.github.io/main/_posts/img/2022-03-27-12-45-32.png)

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dplastico/dplastico.github.io/main/_posts/img/2022-03-27-12-45-55.png)


Listed Above is the CFF explorer representation of the DOS_HEADER, we can see the Values match our expected results and the 0x45DA is on the **e_magic** field. Also The Hex representation confirm the ASCII translation of this as **MZ**. 

We can inspect this fields if we want, but the one is interested to us is the  **e_lfanew** field which is the only one required to have a value for the file to execute, this is because this fields contains a relative offset to the next header, the **NT_HEADER** which is crucial to execution, this fields is located at offset **0x3C** from the beginning of our file, we can check this in CFF explorer also

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dplastico/dplastico.github.io/main/_posts/img/2022-03-27-12-49-50.png)

We can confirm the offset of **0x3c** and the value **0x80**, this value is the offset from the beginning of the file to the NT_HEADER. Which can also confirm in CFF Explorer clicking on the NT_HEADER section

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dplastico/dplastico.github.io/main/_posts/img/2022-03-27-12-51-25.png)

### DOS STUB

Next in the file found the **DOS STUB**. This is a small program created to print a message when the file is executed in MS-DOS. That's why we can usually see in programs a message "This program cannot be run in DOS mode." It worth to keep in mind that this is nor really required to run the file, but still it can help us to locate, for example, a PE loaded inside the program to be loaded in memory, still, this is not always the case, since is mentioned above, you can replace this string and it will not stop the binary to run properly, but still can be part of your reverse engineering routine.

### Rich Header

before the **NT_HEADER** and after the DOS stub, if we look at the program we compiled using CFF explorer, we can see some NULL bytes, just before the **NT_HEADER**, in our case 0x80 bytes from the beginning of the file, this portion of memory is known as the RICH header. 

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dplastico/dplastico.github.io/main/_posts/img/2022-03-27-12-56-25.png)

This header is only populated when the Microsoft Visual Studio suite was used to build the binary. It will contain information about the Tools and versions used. it also can be used as awy to missguided about the author of the program
*https://securelist.com/the-devils-in-the-rich-header/84348/*

### NT HEADER

As mentioned before if we follow the structure up to the 0x3x offset where the e_lfanew field is located we will find the value of the offset to the **NT_HEADER**, the next header in the PE format, this header is part of winnt.h, it's found under **IMAGE_NT_HEADERS**. keep in mind that we are using 32 bit-executables in our example, but if you work on 64-bit this header will be called **NT_HEADERS64**, but the structure will be the same, they also known as PE32 (32-bit) and p32+ (64-bit)

### IMAGE_NT_HEADERS
```c++
typedef struct _IMAGE_NT_HEADERS {
  DWORD                   Signature;
  IMAGE_FILE_HEADER       FileHeader;
  IMAGE_OPTIONAL_HEADER32 OptionalHeader;
} IMAGE_NT_HEADERS32, *PIMAGE_NT_HEADERS32;
```
Listed above is the structure of the header. The first field correspond to the PE Signature, this value it's a DWORD (4 byteS) and should always be "PE" (0x50 and 0x45 in hex) followed by 2 NULL bytes, we can see them in our binary

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dplastico/dplastico.github.io/main/_posts/img/2022-03-27-13-41-11.png)

The second field correspond to another structure the **FILE_HEADER**  followed by the **OPTIONAL_HEADER**, let's take a look at this ones i'm more detail, since they provide a lot of information that can be useful to us

### FILE_HEADER
*https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/debug/pe-format#coff-file-header-object-and-image*

Let's start with the **FILE_HEADER**This header Contains a standard Common Object File Format header (COFF), which holds information about the PE.

```c++
typedef struct _IMAGE_FILE_HEADER {
  WORD  Machine;
  WORD  NumberOfSections;
  DWORD TimeDateStamp;
  DWORD PointerToSymbolTable;
  DWORD NumberOfSymbols;
  WORD  SizeOfOptionalHeader;
  WORD  Characteristics;
}
```
The fields on the structure can be summarized as follow:

- *Machine* : contains the value of the type of architecture that can run the executable, for x86 the value is 0x14c
- *NumberOfSections* : The number of sections in the PE, this is good information since we can have an idea on how the PE is structured. it indicates the size of the table which is followed right after the NT_HEADER
- *TimeStamp* : Universal  Time representation of the creation date of the PE 
- *PointerToSymbolTable* : Pointer to the symbols table (self explanatory)
- *NumberOfSymbols* : (self explanatory)
- *SizeOfOptionalHeader* : self explanatory
- *Characteristics* : Its a flag field which can be combine to provide info for the binary, as an example if the flag 0x2000 is set, this will indicate that the file is a DLL
*https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winnt/ns-winnt-image_file_header*

### OPTIONAL_HEADER

The image optional header is a bigger struct and holds relevant information for the binary to properly load and run. The size of this struct is not fixed and it will depend on how the binary was programmed and compiled. in 32-bit the struct has 31 members, we can see how it constructed below:

```c++
typedef struct _IMAGE_OPTIONAL_HEADER {
  WORD                 Magic;
  BYTE                 MajorLinkerVersion;
  BYTE                 MinorLinkerVersion;
  DWORD                SizeOfCode;
  DWORD                SizeOfInitializedData;
  DWORD                SizeOfUninitializedData;
  DWORD                AddressOfEntryPoint;
  DWORD                BaseOfCode;
  DWORD                BaseOfData;
  DWORD                ImageBase;
  DWORD                SectionAlignment;
  DWORD                FileAlignment;
  WORD                 MajorOperatingSystemVersion;
  WORD                 MinorOperatingSystemVersion;
  WORD                 MajorImageVersion;
  WORD                 MinorImageVersion;
  WORD                 MajorSubsystemVersion;
  WORD                 MinorSubsystemVersion;
  DWORD                Win32VersionValue;
  DWORD                SizeOfImage;
  DWORD                SizeOfHeaders;
  DWORD                CheckSum;
  WORD                 Subsystem;
  WORD                 DllCharacteristics;
  DWORD                SizeOfStackReserve;
  DWORD                SizeOfStackCommit;
  DWORD                SizeOfHeapReserve;
  DWORD                SizeOfHeapCommit;
  DWORD                LoaderFlags;
  DWORD                NumberOfRvaAndSizes;
  IMAGE_DATA_DIRECTORY DataDirectory[IMAGE_NUMBEROF_DIRECTORY_ENTRIES];
}IMAGE_OPTIONAL_HEADER32, *PIMAGE_OPTIONAL_HEADER32;
```
We can see the different field of the **OPTIONAL_HEADER** structure and  that it provides a lot of information about the executable to the OS. We will check the most relevant fields to us now, but I will encourage everyone to take a look at them because it can help us a lot to understand how the binary runs in memory and where it gets its initial information. some of this fields are:

- *Magic* : The state of the image file, executable, ROM, Architecture (x86, x64)
- *AddressOfEntryPoint* : This is interesting since it provides the Relative Virtual Address to the first instruction of the binary itself.
- *ImageBase* : This is the preferred load address of the binary, if there is no collision, the binary will try to load at this address so all the Relative Address will be an offset to this base address. This is important information for us.
- *SizeOfimage* : The size in bytes of the image
- *SizeOfHeaders* : The size of the headers 
- *DLLCharacteristics*: it's a flag field, for example the 0x0400 value will indicate if SEH (structure exception handlers) can be called
- *DataDirectory* : is an array part of DATA_DIRECTORY struct, we will need to investigate this deeper since it's crucial to the PE format

### DATA_DIRECTORY 

As we mentioned above, the DataDirectory array is part of the **DATA_DIRECTORY** struct, and the size of this array is determined by IMAGE_NUMBEROF_DIRECTORY_ENTRIES value in winnt.h, if we look at the source code of mingw we can see that this value is fixed to 16, so we can take not of this.
*https://github.com/Alexpux/mingw-w64/blob/master/mingw-w64-tools/widl/include/winnt.h*

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dplastico/dplastico.github.io/main/_posts/img/2022-03-27-14-02-52.png)

this is how the **DATA_DIRECTORY** struct is defined:

```c++
typedef struct _IMAGE_DATA_DIRECTORY {
  DWORD VirtualAddress;
  DWORD Size;
} IMAGE_DATA_DIRECTORY, *PIMAGE_DATA_DIRECTORY;
```
The DataDirectory is data in the sections of the PE file this can have different information that the loader needs to start the binary, one of the most significant is the Iport Table, or IAT for *Import Address Table* which holds all the functions and modules that the binary needs to load in order to run
*https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/debug/pe-format#optional-header-data-directories-image-only*


### Import Address Table IAT

As mentioned above this structure holds the address of the functions needed for the binary to load and run, this address is resolved in runtime since their original value is the RVA to the function inside the needed module. once the binary is executed this address are resolved and populated in the **IAT**

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dplastico/dplastico.github.io/main/_posts/img/2022-03-27-14-12-37.png)

### Section Table or Section Headers

```c++
typedef struct _IMAGE_SECTION_HEADER {
  BYTE  Name[IMAGE_SIZEOF_SHORT_NAME];
  union {
    DWORD PhysicalAddress;
    DWORD VirtualSize;
  } Misc;
  DWORD VirtualAddress;
  DWORD SizeOfRawData;
  DWORD PointerToRawData;
  DWORD PointerToRelocations;
  DWORD PointerToLinenumbers;
  WORD  NumberOfRelocations;
  WORD  NumberOfLinenumbers;
  DWORD Characteristics;
} IMAGE_SECTION_HEADER, *PIMAGE_SECTION_HEADER;
```

This table its located right after the OPTIONAL HEADER, this is required due to the fact that the **FILE_HEADER** does not have a pointer to the section table and it calculate the location of the Section Table with an offset from the last byte of the **FILE_HEADER**. each entry on the table represent the structure listed above which will be roughly about 40 bytes Some important information we can use from some fields are:

- *Name*: The name of the section (.text, .data, etc)
- *VirtualSize* : Size of the section when loaded in memory
- *VirtualAddress* : The address of the first byte of the section loaded in memory
- *SizeOfRawData* : The size of the data on disk of the binary (.data section)
- *RawAddress* : The offset from the beginning of the PE to the .data section
- *Characteristics* : Again, another flag field, this time it will determine the permissions of the section for example EXEC ONLY, READ ONLY, WRITE AND READ section, etc

### SECTIONS 

Sections are regions of memory that contain the actual code or data needed to execute the binary, so far none of the fields in the headers that we take a look at contain actual code, only references and information. Section do contain code and information used during execution. This section starts at the end of the headers section and can have different names, some of them are reserved.
*https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/debug/pe-format#special-sections*


```c++
typedef struct _IMAGE_SECTION_HEADER {
    BYTE    Name[IMAGE_SIZEOF_SHORT_NAME];
    union {
            DWORD   PhysicalAddress;
            DWORD   VirtualSize;
    } Misc;
    DWORD   VirtualAddress;
    DWORD   SizeOfRawData;
    DWORD   PointerToRawData;
    DWORD   PointerToRelocations;
    DWORD   PointerToLinenumbers;
    WORD    NumberOfRelocations;
    WORD    NumberOfLinenumbers;
    DWORD   Characteristics;
} IMAGE_SECTION_HEADER, *PIMAGE_SECTION_HEADER;
```

Above is a representation of this structure which have different fields, we can observe them in CFF explorer also:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dplastico/dplastico.github.io/main/_posts/img/2022-03-27-17-17-24.png)

*https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/debug/pe-format#section-flags*

Some of the sections presents in an unpacked PE executable to keep in mind are:

- .text: the section where the code of the program and usually only read and execute permissions
- .data: in this section we can found initialized data 
- .rdata: Contains "read only" initialized data 
- .idata: this section contains the imported tables
- .tls: Thread Local Storage

With this we covered a summarized version about how the PE is formed and information about the sections. We will now try to use the information that we just learn to better understand how a binary is "packed" and how we can create a program that perform something similar to a packer that allows us to either obfuscate or create code inside the binary, this is because we are trying to get a Malware Analysis approach to the subject

# Packed binaries

## What is a packed binary?

A packed binary can be referred to as an executable file that is compressed or altered from its original state and is able to execute normally in memory. a "packed binary" it's usually built from a "runtime packer" which we will refer to as "packer".

Packers are known for compression, since they were known for trying to compress the size of the binary itself on disk, but preserve the execution.  These techniques are usually known as "Executable Compression", the idea is that a file can combine compressed data with a decompression code in the same executable, so as described above, it can remain compressed on disk, but executed properly in memory.

The latter is commonly used for malware to "hide itself" from Anti Virus Solutions or other threat detections mechanism from software installed in the computer or analyzing the traffic on the network. So we will see that packers are very popular in Malware programs for that exact reason.

We will take a look at a packed binary, we will pack and modify the structure of the files in order to understand how this information can help us to not only create packed binaries, but also to unpack an already obfuscated or compressed binary.

# Packing binaries

## Packing a binary with UPX
*https://github.com/upx*

Before we start analyzing packed binaries lets try ourselves to first pack the binary we just created, for that I will rename the a.exe binary to **unpacked.exe** also lets create a copy of the same program to pack and lets call it **upx_packed.exe**

Great, now let's start by looking at how we will pack the binary, as the title of this section says, we will use **UPX**.

The "Ultimate Packer for Executables" or UPX https://upx.github.io/ is a free executable packer for several formats.

We can download the upx executable for windows from here https://github.com/upx/upx/releases/tag/v3.96. And we can add it to our environment variables or we can just copy it to the directory we are working on.

Now lets execute it with the following command and let's analyze what changes made to the binary

Execute:
>$upx packed_upx.exe

With this the file will be packed. You can check the size of the new packed_upx.exe file is smaller than the original, this is due to the compression that UPX apply, and if you execute it works properly

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dplastico/dplastico.github.io/main/_posts/img/2022-03-27-17-43-51.png)

Let's take a look now at the binary itself and see if we can spot more differences.
unpacked.exe:
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dplastico/dplastico.github.io/main/_posts/img/2022-03-27-17-48-09.png)

packed_upx.exe:
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dplastico/dplastico.github.io/main/_posts/img/2022-03-27-17-48-52.png)

The common sections that we saw before in the now unpacked.exe are replaced for 3 sections UPX0 UPX1 UPX2 in the packed_upx.exe binary that show us how the data is changed inside the binary and in the regular structure of itself. 


![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dplastico/dplastico.github.io/main/_posts/img/2022-03-27-17-50-40.png)
Above also, the  entrypoint of the binary in x32dbg in runtime, looks totally different and it changes also
unpacked.exe:
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dplastico/dplastico.github.io/main/_posts/img/2022-03-27-17-53-01.png)

packed_upx.exe:
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dplastico/dplastico.github.io/main/_posts/img/2022-03-27-17-52-18.png)

Finally listed above you can see that there's also a difference between the number of functions called from different DLLs, there are much more in the original file than in the compressed one. This is because the packer, in order to compress the size, will try to load everything that it needs with the least amount possible of *API calls*. This is, on the case of UPX, to effectively reduce the size of the binary

This is interesting since LoadLibraryA  will allow you to load a module and *GetProcAddress* to resolve the Address of a given function, so the packer can start resolving the function that it will use. This can explain why there are only a few functions being imported and the reason behind it.

*https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/libloaderapi/nf-libloaderapi-getprocaddress*
*https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/libloaderapi/nf-libloaderapi-loadlibrarya*

## Creating a Simple "packer" (more like a "patcher") in python

In order to better understand how a packer can manipulate an executable outside of compression, let's create a simple packer in python that will help us to accomplish our goal. Just  modify a binary and test it, the packer will create a section with some bytes and then write code to the executable and redirect execution there. We will not apply compression or we will try to not modify  the original code yet, this is just to show how can we pack some data or modify existing one into an executable

We now also know that ASLR should be disable on the binary, since we compiled with the "-no-pie" flag, but we can still check this out. If the flag **IMAGE_FILE_RELOCS_STRIPPED** un Characteristics is set to 0x0001, ASLR should be disable for the binary. We can verify this on CFF explorer

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dplastico/dplastico.github.io/main/_posts/img/2022-03-26-19-50-00.png)

Great, also we will use for this section  the **pefile** python module, that will allow us to parse information from the PE structures and also modify them. You can install it with the command:

```bash
pip install pefile
```
*https://github.com/erocarrera/pefile*

Great,  to test how it works let's read all the data from the executable to a variable and then check the last section of the binary, let use the following code:

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3
import sys
import pefile

#load teh executable into the "pe" variable object
pe = pefile.PE('unpacked.exe')
#We store the last section information in the variable "last section"
lastSection = pe.sections[-1]

print(lastSection)
```

When executed we can see the results:
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dplastico/dplastico.github.io/main/_posts/img/2022-03-27-18-09-42.png)

And we can cross reference them with the information on CFF Explorer

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dplastico/dplastico.github.io/main/_posts/img/2022-03-27-18-11-06.png)

Great the pefile module works, we can learn more about what we can do with this module in their documentation 
*https://github.com/erocarrera/pefile/blob/wiki/UsageExamples.md#introduction*

So now the question remains, What can we build in order to "pack" this binary, we could encode or rename a section, but to do something more interactive, and simple, lets just create a "packed section" and inject some code there, that will execute before, the binary executes itself. This sounds nothing to do with packers, but it will simplify the fact of building a proper packer tool, instead lets have more the "hacker" approach. With this in consideration lets then try to execute the following

* Create a new section in te binary
* Redirect the entry Point Address to our created section
* Execute our payload
* Return to normal execution

Ok, we have our objectives let's start by creating our new Section where we will jump after modifying the entry point, remember the whole idea is just to create simple packing proof of concept also Lets now set our newly created section after the last section in the binary that we identified under "lastSection"

 We can accomplish that with the following code:


```python
#!/usr/bin/python3
import sys
import pefile

#load teh executable into the "pe" variable object
pe = pefile.PE('unpacked.exe')
#We store the last section information in the variable "last section"
lastSection = pe.sections[-1]

#Create a new section header in a variable
newSection = pefile.SectionStructure(pe.__IMAGE_SECTION_HEADER_format__)
#fill the new section with NULL bytes
newSection.__unpack__(bytearray(newSection.sizeof()))
#setting in place our newSection
newSection.set_file_offset(lastSection.get_file_offset() + lastSection.sizeof())

```
Lets now set our newly created section after the last section in the binary that we identified under "lastSection", we will name this section as ".packed". but also, before that we need to address an issue, at this point if we add the new section it will not be displayed under sections, this is because the sections depend on the NumberOfSections field in the FILE_HEADER. so we need to add 1 to the current value on it before writing this to the file. So let's code this and write this to an executable, we will read from the "unpacked.exe" file and we will write to a new file that we will call "packed_python.exe":


```python
#!/usr/bin/python3
import sys
import pefile

#load the executable into the "pe" variable object
pe = pefile.PE('./unpacked.exe')
#We store the last section information in the variable "last section"
lastSection = pe.sections[-1]

#Create a new section header in a variable
newSection = pefile.SectionStructure(pe.__IMAGE_SECTION_HEADER_format__)
#fill the new section with NULL bytes
newSection.__unpack__(bytearray(newSection.sizeof()))
#setting in place our newSection
newSection.set_file_offset(lastSection.get_file_offset() + lastSection.sizeof())
#Set a name for the section, in this case ".packed"
newSection.Name = b".packed"# we need to pass as bytes
# increase number of sections
pe.FILE_HEADER.NumberOfSections += 1
#We also had the following two lines to write the new sections to our pe object
pe.sections.append(newSection)
pe.__structures__.append(newSection)

#write the modified pe to an executable file on disk
pe.write('./python_packed.exe')
```
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dplastico/dplastico.github.io/main/_posts/img/2022-03-27-00-16-15.png)

Execution looks clean and the python_packed.exe file was created. We can explore the binary with CFF again to see if we managed to modify the PE.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dplastico/dplastico.github.io/main/_posts/img/2022-03-27-00-17-39.png)

Listed above appears the new section created named ".packed".  but when we try to execute the newly created file we receive an error that the file cannot be run in put PC

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dplastico/dplastico.github.io/main/_posts/img/2022-03-27-00-21-06.png)

Why does this happen? The new section we created has no values in any field of the section, we need to populate the permissions. Let's set Execute, Read and Execute permissions so that way later we can try to execute shellcode we can add this  values, in order to that we need to set the flags for the Characteristics Field of the sections header to match the .text section so we need to set the flags IMAGE_SCN_CNT_CODE,IMAGE_SCN_MEM_EXECUTE, IIMAGE_SCN_MEM_READ. We can search for this values in the microsoft documentation and then add them the new Section
*https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/debug/pe-format#section-flags*


```python
newSection.Characteristics = 0x40000000 | 0x20000000 | 0x20 # IMAGE_SCN_MEM_READ | IMAGE_SCN_MEM_EXECUTE | IMAGE_SCN_CNT_CODE 
```
Now we also need to set the Values for the Misc, Physical Address, VirtualSize fields, let's set them to an arbitrary 0x100 size
*https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35685589/how-do-i-make-space-for-my-code-cave-in-a-windows-pe-32bit-executable*

```python
newSection.Misc = 0x100
newSection.Misc_PhysicalAddress = 0x100 
newSection.Misc_VirtualSize = 0x100
```
Next the section Virtual Address needs to be set, since we can parse the fields in the lastSection variable object, let‚Äôs add to his virtual address  and use the following function to calculate the proper size for the Virtual address, the code its self explanatory

```python
#This is a function to properly align the size of the new section we are adding 
def alignSectionSize(size, align):

  if size % align == 0:
    value = size
  else:
    value = ((size+align) // align) * align
  return value
```

With this in consideration, let's add it to the newSection object Variable:

```python
newSection.VirtualAddress = lastSection.VirtualAddress + alignSectionSize(lastSection.Misc_VirtualSize, pe.OPTIONAL_HEADER.SectionAlignment)
```

finally we can set the SizeOfImage this time we will pass as argument the 0x100 value chosen before fot the VirtualSize.  We are ready to write this changes and test if the binary now can execute.

```python
pe.OPTIONAL_HEADER.SizeOfImage += alignSectionSize(0x100, pe.OPTIONAL_HEADER.SectionAlignment)
```

The program executes cleanly and the packed binary is created, and also executes properly as you can see in the following image:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dplastico/dplastico.github.io/main/_posts/img/2022-03-27-02-18-18.png)

Also If we open the newly created binary in CFF we can see that the sections were set as we planned. 

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dplastico/dplastico.github.io/main/_posts/img/2022-03-27-02-20-01.png)

So our POC works, we can modify the PE, but we only added a section, we still need to redirect the execution of the program, we could overwrite The section in .text where on the Entry Point we previously identified, but why don't we just overwrite the value in "AddressOfEntryPoint" field, this should redirect the execution.

We know the entry point of the program since we can parse the AddressOfEntryPoint field in the OPTIONAL_HEADER we know that this value is the Relative Address to the ImageBase, which we can also Obtain from the ImageBase Field also in the OPTIONAL_HEADER. lets add those values and also lets code prints to the program in case we need to follow the flow of execution.


```python
#Getting the value of the ImageBase into a variable
imageBase = pe.OPTIONAL_HEADER.ImageBase
print(f"[*] Imagebase = {hex(imageBase)}")
#Getting the value of the AddressOfEntryPoint into a variable
pe_oep = pe.OPTIONAL_HEADER.AddressOfEntryPoint
print(f"[*] AddressOfEntryPoint = {hex(pe_oep)}")
#Calculate the entrypoint in execution
exec_ep = imageBase+pe_oep
print(f"[*] Etnry Point in Execution = {hex(exec_ep)}")
```
Listed above we can find the values of ImageBase and  AddressOfEntryPoint were set to a variable, we can calculate in the exec_ep variable the value of the Original Entry Point in memory, since we compile the binary with -fno-pie flag

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dplastico/dplastico.github.io/main/_posts/img/2022-03-27-03-30-01.png)

Since when the no relocation flag was setted we know that this address will be fixed, still lets check it out in a debugger. We need to pass some exceptions until we reach the INT3 breakpoint for Entry Point, as you can see below, the entry point matches. So we now know how to obtain the address of entry point and now lest modified to point out our code

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dplastico/dplastico.github.io/main/_posts/img/2022-03-27-03-46-45.png)

Now let's modify the Entry point and print it to see if we have the same result in our analysis. Keep in mind that we need to calculate the SizeOfRawData first, and we can accomplish this by using our alignment function to obtain the size we should use in the field

We can code the above like this:

```python
#in order to write we need to align the SizeofRawData of the section
newSection.SizeOfRawData = alignSectionSize(0x100, pe.OPTIONAL_HEADER.FileAlignment)

#redirect the entry point to the beginning of our newly created section
#first let's set the Address Of entry point to point to our new section
pe.OPTIONAL_HEADER.AddressOfEntryPoint = newSection.VirtualAddress
#let's save the ep in the new_ep variable
new_ep = pe.OPTIONAL_HEADER.AddressOfEntryPoint + imageBase
print(f"[*] Modified entry point at {hex(new_ep)}")
```

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dplastico/dplastico.github.io/main/_posts/img/2022-03-27-18-58-04.png)

After execution we see the code is executed correctly and it display the address 0x411000

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dplastico/dplastico.github.io/main/_posts/img/2022-03-27-18-58-58.png)

And when dynamically analyzing in the debugger we see above that the entry point matches the patched Entry Point address. We were able to redirect the code execution on the executable

## Creating a simple shellcode

Since we are testing the "packer" to see if  it can hide malicious code, let's start by creating a payload, in the form of a shellcode that can help us to execute something. Let's try to pop up a window with a message. for this we will create the shellcode in a separate file to just print it and copied into our payload, you can obviously use something to generate the payload, in my case I will use a python script to compile the instructions, there's no room on this post to properly explain shellcoding, you could also create compiled code and use it, but this is something to make it easy and also, Shellcoding is always a good exercise, you can use the shellcode form this post or try one yourself.
*https://www.corelan.be/index.php/2010/02/25/exploit-writing-tutorial-part-9-introduction-to-win32-shellcoding/*

```python
import struct
from keystone import *
import sys
from capstone import *

code = (
'''  Write assembly instruction here in strings, as the example:
"mov eax, edx     ;"
"pop eax           ;"
'''
)

ks = Ks(KS_ARCH_X86, KS_MODE_32)

opcodes = ks.asm(code)

sh = b""
for e in opcodes[0]:
    sh += struct.pack("B",e)

shellcode = bytearray(sh)

md = Cs(CS_ARCH_X86, CS_MODE_32)
for i in md.disasm(shellcode, 0x0):
    print("0x%x:\t%s\t%s\t%s" %  (i.address, i.bytes.hex(), i.mnemonic, i.op_str))

total_shellcode = ''.join("\\x%02x" % i for i in shellcode)
print("\nlenght of the shellcode = %d bytes\n" % len(total_shellcode) )
print(f'"{total_shellcode}"')
```
We can use the  code above  to create the shellcode, as I mentioned I will not provide details on the shellcode creation, you can use this base script to create yours or use the raw bytes used in this post, they are Position Independent it should work on your code. This is the generated shellcode you can use, if you don't want to code it:

```python
"\x60\x89\xe5\x81\xc4\xf0\xf9\xff\xff\x31\xc9\x64\x8b\x71\x30\x8b\x76\x0c\x8b\x76\x1c\x8b\x5e\x08\x8b\x7e\x20\x8b\x36\x66\x39\x4f\x18\x75\xf2\xeb\x06\x5e\x89\x75\x04\xeb\x54\xe8\xf5\xff\xff\xff\x60\x8b\x43\x3c\x8b\x7c\x03\x78\x01\xdf\x8b\x4f\x18\x8b\x47\x20\x01\xd8\x89\x45\xfc\xe3\x36\x49\x8b\x45\xfc\x8b\x34\x88\x01\xde\x31\xc0\x99\xfc\xac\x84\xc0\x74\x07\xc1\xca\x0d\x01\xc2\xeb\xf4\x3b\x54\x24\x24\x75\xdf\x8b\x57\x24\x01\xda\x66\x8b\x0c\x4a\x8b\x57\x1c\x01\xda\x8b\x04\x8a\x01\xd8\x89\x44\x24\x1c\x61\xc3\x68\x83\xb9\xb5\x78\xff\x55\x04\x89\x45\x10\x68\x8e\x4e\x0e\xec\xff\x55\x04\x89\x45\x14\x31\xc0\x66\xb8\x6c\x6c\x50\x68\x33\x32\x2e\x64\x68\x75\x73\x65\x72\x54\xff\x55\x14\x89\xc3\x68\xa8\xa2\x4d\xbc\xff\x55\x04\x89\x45\x20\x31\xc0\x66\x05\x65\x64\x50\x68\x68\x61\x63\x6b\x89\xe2\x31\xc0\x50\x68\x68\x61\x63\x6b\x89\xe7\x50\x52\x57\x50\xff\x55\x20\x31\xc0\x05\xe0\x12\x40\x00\xff\xe0"
```
The created shellcode will pop a Message Box with the word "hacked" and then will redirect execution to the entry point. Now, let's upgrade our python script to write these changes to the "python_packed.exe".

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3
import sys
import pefile

#This is a function to properly align the size of the new section we are adding 
def alignSectionSize(size, align):

  if size % align == 0:
    value = size
  else:
    value = ((size+align) // align) * align
  return value
  
#load teh executable into the "pe" variable object
pe = pefile.PE('./unpacked.exe')
#We store the last section information in the variable "last section"
lastSection = pe.sections[-1]

#Create a new section header in a variable
newSection = pefile.SectionStructure(pe.__IMAGE_SECTION_HEADER_format__)
#fill the new section with NULL bytes
newSection.__unpack__(bytearray(newSection.sizeof()))
#setting in place our newSection
newSection.set_file_offset(lastSection.get_file_offset() + lastSection.sizeof())
#Set a name for the section, in this case ".packed"
newSection.Name = b".packed"# we need to pass as bytes
# increase number of sections
pe.FILE_HEADER.NumberOfSections += 1

#set read executable permissions on the  new section
newSection.Characteristics = 0x40000000 | 0x20000000 | 0x80000000 | 0x20 # IMAGE_SCN_MEM_READ | IMAGE_SCN_MEM_EXECUTE |IMAGE_SCN_MEM_WRITE| IMAGE_SCN_CNT_CODE 

#We set need to set the value of the Misc, Physical address and virtual size, I choose 0x100
newSection.Misc = 0x100
newSection.Misc_PhysicalAddress = 0x100 
newSection.Misc_VirtualSize = 0x100

#add a proper size to VirtualAddress
newSection.VirtualAddress = lastSection.VirtualAddress + alignSectionSize(lastSection.Misc_VirtualSize, pe.OPTIONAL_HEADER.SectionAlignment)

#Calculate the value for the SizeOfImage header
pe.OPTIONAL_HEADER.SizeOfImage += alignSectionSize(0x100, pe.OPTIONAL_HEADER.SectionAlignment) #0x100 is the chosen value for the size of the section

#Getting the value of the ImageBase into a variable
imageBase = pe.OPTIONAL_HEADER.ImageBase
print(f"[*] Imagebase = {hex(imageBase)}")
#Getting the value of the AddressOfEntryPoint into a variable
pe_oep = pe.OPTIONAL_HEADER.AddressOfEntryPoint
print(f"[*] AddressOfEntryPoint = {hex(pe_oep)}")
#Calculate the entrypoint in execution
exec_ep = imageBase + pe_oep
print(f"[*] Entry Point in Execution = {hex(exec_ep)}")
#in order to write we need to align the SizeofRawData of the section
newSection.SizeOfRawData = alignSectionSize(0x100, pe.OPTIONAL_HEADER.FileAlignment)
newSection.PointerToRawData = pe.OPTIONAL_HEADER.AddressOfEntryPoint
#redirect the entry point to the beginning of our newly created section
#first let's set the Address Of entry point to point to our new section
pe.OPTIONAL_HEADER.AddressOfEntryPoint = 0x4020 #entry point set to .data
#let's save the ep in the new_ep variable
new_ep = pe.OPTIONAL_HEADER.AddressOfEntryPoint + imageBase
print(f"[*] Modified entry point at {hex(new_ep)}")
#lets create a bytearray where we can inject our shellcode
#payload = bytearray(newSection.SizeOfRawData)
#shellcode = b"\x90"*newSection.SizeOfRawData
#We also add the following to lines to write to disk
pe.sections.append(newSection)
pe.__structures__.append(newSection)

#copying MessagerBoxA shellcode that returns execution to the Original Entry Point
shellcode = b"\x90"*8
shellcode += b"\x60\x89\xe5\x81\xc4\xf0\xf9\xff\xff\x31\xc9\x64\x8b\x71\x30\x8b\x76\x0c\x8b\x76\x1c\x8b\x5e\x08\x8b\x7e\x20\x8b\x36\x66\x39\x4f\x18\x75\xf2\xeb\x06\x5e\x89\x75\x04\xeb\x54\xe8\xf5\xff\xff\xff\x60\x8b\x43\x3c\x8b\x7c\x03\x78\x01\xdf\x8b\x4f\x18\x8b\x47\x20\x01\xd8\x89\x45\xfc\xe3\x36\x49\x8b\x45\xfc\x8b\x34\x88\x01\xde\x31\xc0\x99\xfc\xac\x84\xc0\x74\x07\xc1\xca\x0d\x01\xc2\xeb\xf4\x3b\x54\x24\x24\x75\xdf\x8b\x57\x24\x01\xda\x66\x8b\x0c\x4a\x8b\x57\x1c\x01\xda\x8b\x04\x8a\x01\xd8\x89\x44\x24\x1c\x61\xc3\x68\x83\xb9\xb5\x78\xff\x55\x04\x89\x45\x10\x68\x8e\x4e\x0e\xec\xff\x55\x04\x89\x45\x14\x31\xc0\x66\xb8\x6c\x6c\x50\x68\x33\x32\x2e\x64\x68\x75\x73\x65\x72\x54\xff\x55\x14\x89\xc3\x68\xa8\xa2\x4d\xbc\xff\x55\x04\x89\x45\x20\x31\xc0\x66\x05\x65\x64\x50\x68\x68\x61\x63\x6b\x89\xe2\x31\xc0\x50\x68\x68\x61\x63\x6b\x89\xe7\x50\x52\x57\x50\xff\x55\x20\x31\xc0\x05\xe0\x12\x40\x00\xff\xe0"
#writing the shellcode to .data section
print("[*] Writing shellcode to binary....")
print(pe.set_bytes_at_offset(0x3020, shellcode)) #writing to recalculated offset size
#writing to disk
pe.write('./python_packed.exe')
print("[*] Done!")

```

Listed above is the code used to modify the binary. With what we have learned plus the comments, it should be easy to follow along, but basically the script does this:

- Create a new section ".packed"
- Write a shellcode to ".data" + 0x20
- Change the entry point of the PE to ".data" + 0x20
- Executes shellcode on ".data"
- Return Execution to OEP (Original Entry Point)

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dplastico/dplastico.github.io/main/_posts/img/2022-03-31-01-33-26.png)

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dplastico/dplastico.github.io/main/_posts/img/2022-03-31-01-33-39.png)

Great, above we can see that after executing the program a MessageBox appears and once we click on it, execution is redirected to the OEP and the program continues normal execution.

If we think on what we did, we were able to totally change the executable code flow, a malware can do the same it can have encrypted data that it will be decrypt on execution, and then, change the flow of execution to it, this way, avoiding external defenses mechanism, like an EDR.

We could create one of those, but the main idea is to learn about unpacking, so you can give it a try. In the next sections we will use this knowledge to start unpacking binaries.

# Unpacking binaries

Now that we know how an executable is constructed and how packers works, let's try to unpack a upx binary, let's code another small C program, this time we will just ask for some user input in order to stop execution after we launch the program to avoid it closing itself.

This is the source code of the program

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main(){
    char check[8]="dpladpla";
    char buf[8];
    
    puts("Please provide the secret password.");
    read(0, buf, 8);
       
    if(strncmp(buf, check, 8)==0){
        puts("Secret password is correct");
        return 0;
    }
    puts("Incorrect secret password\n");
    return 1;
}
```

We can compile it with 

```bash
gcc -fno-pie testing.c -o testing
```
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dplastico/dplastico.github.io/main/_posts/img/2022-03-28-00-06-42.png)

We can test it's working by simply executing it as shown above. Now that we know that our program works,lets create a backup copy and  pack it using upx with the following command:

```bash
upx testing.exe
```
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dplastico/dplastico.github.io/main/_posts/img/2022-03-28-00-10-57.png)

First we can confirm that our binary works, by just executing it.

## UPX unpack

Let's now pack the just created "testing.exe" binary using UPX, and let's analyze this binary remember we can pack it using the upx binary and exe

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dplastico/dplastico.github.io/main/_posts/img/2022-03-28-00-17-48.png)

No issues seem to appear so we can now check how the binary is being altered and the sections have been renamed to UPX0, UPX1 and UPX3. This time we will use IDA to check the segments, we can do it by going to view -> segments. We will use IDA because we will start to apply more Reverse Engineering from now on.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dplastico/dplastico.github.io/main/_posts/img/2022-03-28-00-23-09.png)

Also if we look at the code we cannot identify the usual Entry  Point or functions, as an example below we will contrat how the code looks in the backup with no UPX packing and with packing

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dplastico/dplastico.github.io/main/_posts/img/2022-03-28-00-26-09.png)

Listed above we can see how the main functions and the assembly code of the binary looks normal

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dplastico/dplastico.github.io/main/_posts/img/2022-03-28-00-27-31.png)

While above we can clearly see the code has changed and it looks more difficult to follow or spot.

This is why packing is so used in Malware Analysis even comercial packers can complicate the reverse engineering process. Now we will take a look on how to unpack this binary

In order to unpack this binary we can use UPX and just throw this command

> upx -d testing.exe

But since we want to investigate deeper, let's see if we can spot the unpacked binary and  if we can "unpack" it not relaying on the upx solution

## Manually unpacking UPX binary

For this section we will use **x32dbg** Since we will dynamically analyze the binary, let's first open up our original binary renamed as "backup_testing.exe, remember that "testing.exe" was packed with UPX. 

Since we already know how, in theory, a packer like UPX works, we will assume that from the entry point will start to run functionality to resolve imported functions and restore the code to a certain memory region, where it will jump after to execute the original executable

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dplastico/dplastico.github.io/main/_posts/img/2022-03-28-16-52-05.png)

We can take a note or screenshot of the entry point, and if we scroll down we will see imported modules  and then the main function

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dplastico/dplastico.github.io/main/_posts/img/2022-03-28-16-55-52.png)

So we expect to follow the execution of the code in the packed binary and let's try to figure out if we can extract the original file from the executable.

First let's examine the entry point

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dplastico/dplastico.github.io/main/_posts/img/2022-03-28-17-07-58.png)

We can see that the entry point, as we expected, looks totally different. From here we can do several things to try to look for the original code, but something to keep in mind is our first instruction, PUSHAD in address 0x00412170, this instruction pushes the contents of the general-purpose registers onto the stack. This can be used to preserve the state of the registers to later on restore it with a POPAD instruction; this instruction pops values from the stack into the general-purpose registers. Taking that into consideration we can follow up the code looking for a POPAD instruction to see where this registers are restored


![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dplastico/dplastico.github.io/main/_posts/img/2022-03-28-17-19-28.png)

We found a POPAD in the address 0x003122ED, follow by a small jump back, and right after to instructions call our attention, first we see the stack pointer being modified, so the stack now point in another direction, and then in address 0x0041230B a JMP instruction  to a different memory region in address 0x004012E0. Let's investigate that

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dplastico/dplastico.github.io/main/_posts/img/2022-03-28-17-24-39.png)

Listed above are the regions that we can access through the "memory map" tab in x32dbg, and we can determine that the address 0x004012E0 corresponds to the section UPX0, while our curren EIP where the execution is currently located in address 0x00412170 corresponds to UPX2 section. Let's follow the memory to where the jump is pointing to 0x004012E0. We can accomplish this right clicking on the jmp instruction and selectrin 
"follow in dump" and the selecting the mentioned address

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dplastico/dplastico.github.io/main/_posts/img/2022-03-28-17-30-13.png)

Listed above we can see that the region only contains NULL bytes, this means that after execution the stub created by the packer will decompress the data into this region and will allocate the original code, let's test this by setting a breakpoint on the jump (you can just select the instruction and press F2, or right click breakpoints and then select toggle), and start tracing the execution from there. A nice feature by x32dbg is that the memory region selected will automatically change if that's the case so we will spot immediately if the 

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dplastico/dplastico.github.io/main/_posts/img/2022-03-28-17-37-27.png)

After hitting our breakpoint we can  see that the region is now fully populated with data, lets see if this match our original entry point:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dplastico/dplastico.github.io/main/_posts/img/2022-03-28-17-40-40.png)

Great, we can see that the jmp instruction lands us on what looks exactly like our entry point. Lets see now if we can extract the binary

## Extracting the binary

To extract the binary we will relay on a plugin commonly used with x32dbg, since we can obviously manually extract the bytes, but we will need to manually import the modules and that could be tedious, let's use the **Scylla** plugin, this plugin will build a binary from file from the memory location we are pointing to. The plugin is located under plugins while keeping selected the first instruction on the Original Entry Point, OEP.
*https://github.com/NtQuery/Scylla*


![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dplastico/dplastico.github.io/main/_posts/img/2022-03-28-17-45-19.png)

Once the plugin is open ad shown above click on "IAT autosearch", and then on "Get Imports"  after that you can just click on "dump" and named the binary, I will call it "extracted.exe". Lets test if we were success by executing the binary

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dplastico/dplastico.github.io/main/_posts/img/2022-03-28-17-58-55.png)

The binary fails in execution, something must be wrong with the binary, so let's open the executable in CFF explorer to investigate

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dplastico/dplastico.github.io/main/_posts/img/2022-03-28-18-02-58.png)

Listed above in the IAT from the extracted payload we can see that the IAT was not properly reconstructed by the Scylla plugin. 

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dplastico/dplastico.github.io/main/_posts/img/2022-03-28-18-07-55.png)

This have a quick fix, after dumping our "extracted.exe" we should select "fix binary"as shown above  on the dump section, and select our "extracted.exe" file.This should Create a file named "extracted_SYC.exe" in the current directory.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dplastico/dplastico.github.io/main/_posts/img/2022-03-28-18-10-18.png)

We can see that the issue was fixed and now the binary executes properly

# Manually unpack a malware sample

Using what we learn lets try to unpack a malware sample, using the tools we have used so far, in order to do that a disclaimer need to be made, you need to be EXTRA careful when dealing with malware, I will use a real sample on this link:

https[:]// malshare.com/sample.php?action=detail&hash=612974dcb49adef982d9ad8d9cbdde36 

the URL is altered just in case, but the download is not direct, but just to be safe and also this is a  good practice when sharing malware samples links, you will also need to create a user to be able to download the file, and also please use it on a VM isolated from your network and your host computer. 

I will  be using the FLARE VM, which I recommend, please use this link if you want to install it.
*https://github.com/mandiant/flare-vm*

We will also be working with a sample of GlobelImposter a malware from the Ransomware family
*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ransomware*
https://blog.malwarebytes.com/detections/ransom-globeimposter/#:~:text=GlobeImposter%20is%20a%20ransomware%20application,mimics%20the%20Globe%20ransomware%20family%20.

All Right!, so we downloaded the sample malware and put it in our desktop,
I will rename it as globelimposter.exe and we can see that it has a calendar Icon, a trick for the user to think it's a safe file.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dplastico/dplastico.github.io/main/_posts/img/2022-03-29-14-06-23.png)

I took a screenshot of the VM in this state, the idea is to show the malware is really dangerous, you don't need to recreate this, and as mentioned before, be EXTRA careful when working with malware samples and only execute them in a controlled environment.

If we execute the malware, we will see that it will encrypt our files, let's take a look (If you want try this again, be careful)

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dplastico/dplastico.github.io/main/_posts/img/2022-03-29-20-26-44.png)

Listed above we can see  the malware being executed and the files on the desktop being renamed and encrypted.

Now let's take a static look with CFF Explorer. The sections looks good, nothing suspicious, so let's see if we can get something from more deeper analysis

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dplastico/dplastico.github.io/main/_posts/img/2022-03-29-14-11-24.png)

Listed above the sections of the *globelimposter* ransomware. 

## Static Analysis

Let's open first the binary in IDA for some static analysis and let's see if we can spot something through the code. It is good to know that every Windows program should have a WinMain  or wWinMain Function as entry point
*https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/learnwin32/winmain--the-application-entry-point*

```c++
int WINAPI wWinMain(HINSTANCE hInstance, HINSTANCE hPrevInstance, PWSTR pCmdLine, int nCmdShow);
```
so on the entry point we can look for this function, obviously there are no symbols for this program 

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dplastico/dplastico.github.io/main/_posts/img/2022-03-29-15-20-18.png)

We can still search for the WinMain function; the first parameter, the *hInstance* definition it's a handle to a module or to the instance. so we can see on the block of code listed above the value "0x400000" is being passed last to the function *sub_401100* and before that a 0 is passed and on as the *hPrevInstance* value and according to  Microsoft documentation this value should be zero since is a  16 bit legacy parameter, so 0x400000 looks like the handle and a zero after can provide a clue that this is the WinMain function so let's rename it _winmain for now, and let's inspect that function

If we follow what we learn so far, there should be a call to either Import de obfuscated or hidden Windows modules and functions that will be imported, usually this is done with LoadLibraryA and *GetProcessAddress*, as mentioned before. But we already can realize that the code has some obfuscation and part of the code is clearly meant to try to difficult the reverse engineering process and the analysis from potential EDR solutions.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dplastico/dplastico.github.io/main/_posts/img/2022-03-29-15-27-33.png)

Listed above you can see that there are a lot if calls different WIN APIs, like *WinHttpOpen*, but they are only taking "0" as arguments, again this is to distract, someone looking at the file, from what the malware is really doing

So now that we are in WinMain, we can try to look for the malicious code of the malware. The program would probably move execution  with a call  instruction to a function or a jmp opcode to the function where the "stub" that will unpack the malicious program is located, or maybe it will return to the same function we are now and then jump again

Also, we already know that in order to "unpack" the malicious code to some location. Some APIs that are used can be *VirtualProtect*, *VirtualAlloc* or *WriteProcessMemory*, This API's can change the permissions in a certain memory region, write bytes to memory and other things, I will strongly recommend to read about this 3 functions
*https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-virtualprotect*
*https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-virtualalloc*
*https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-writeprocessmemory*

To do this we should resolve the KERNEL32.dll (or the module where the function we want it to use is located) and then a string with the name be resolved by *GetProcAddress*. Let's see if we can spot that functionality on the disassembly.

If we look for the string representation of any of these functions, we would not find it. This is common in malware since the program will try to hide the call to these functions, since they are usually on packing and process injection.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dplastico/dplastico.github.io/main/_posts/img/2022-03-29-15-55-04.png)

Listed above we do find a call to GetProcAddress, great, but we cannot identify at first glance what  values are being passed as arguments. There's some movement of certain ASCII characters being stored in an offset of memory that IDAnamed "mem" if we take note of them, they look like ascii characters being stored, then they are pushed as argument to GetProcAddress and remember that the return of this function is the address of the requested one and by standard by microsoft documentation it will be returned on EAX

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dplastico/dplastico.github.io/main/_posts/img/2022-03-29-16-05-49.png)

If we use python as shown above we can Identify the string constructed as *VirtualProtect*, so we now know that this malware will try to change some permissions in a memory region, and maybe after that continue execution there.


![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dplastico/dplastico.github.io/main/_posts/img/2022-03-29-16-37-07.png)

Following the code inside this block we can see that right after the call to *GetProcAddress* EAX is being moved to a memory location on **0x518b90** that IDA has renamed *dword_518B90* (keep in mind that this section may be subject to ASLR) . So we should definitely check what data is being passed and where this function returns.

Also keep in mind that there's a call to a value on the stack right after, This is named by ida "ebp+var_14", we can check at the beginning of the code that the value of var_14 is -0x14 so we now this is a stack offset of -0x14 from ebp.

Remember that VirtualProtect will change the permissions in an specific memory area, so this should be an address on the same region that VirtualProtect is changing permissions, we can take a look at where a value is passed to the named "ebp+var_14" location to see where is pointing

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dplastico/dplastico.github.io/main/_posts/img/2022-03-29-18-08-21.png)

Above we can check that the value **0x8700** is passed to the stack, that IDA renamed as "ebp+ubytes" this value is then moved to ECX and then pushed to the stack followed by a 0 being pushed also and later a call to *LocalAlloc*. 
*https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winbase/nf-winbase-localalloc*

```c++
DECLSPEC_ALLOCATOR HLOCAL LocalAlloc(
  [in] UINT   uFlags,
  [in] SIZE_T uBytes
);
```

Above we can see the details of the function This function will allocate memory on the heap, using the uBytes as size in our case we know is 0x8700 bytes and the a flag value of zero as uFlags, if we look at the documentation of the API, we know that a value of zero will make the function return a pointer to the allocated data, we know by convention the return value of a function is on EAX so we now know that this will be the region that VirtualProtect will change permissions.
*https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/memory/heap-functions*

Lets see if our analysis is correct by analyzing the program in the debugger.

## Dynamic Analysis and malware extraction

Based on our static analysis we should corroborate that:

- Identify the call to WinMain, and observe if we are correct in our analysis
- Identify the call to *VirtualProtect*
- Follow the execution from VirtualProtect to see if we can spot the malicious code.

Ok then so lets execute the file on the debugger but, again we should pause on Entry Point since, we don't want the ransomware to fully execute or the machine will be infected and we will need to revert it with a snapshot.

Once we open the file on x32dbg we can check the breakpoints tab to check the breakpoint that x32dbg sets by default on the entry point of the program. so we are safe to click run since we will hit that breakpoint, again be EXTRA careful and always check first


![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dplastico/dplastico.github.io/main/_posts/img/2022-03-29-14-19-54.png)

So lets click run and we can observe that we are on the entry point same as IDA

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dplastico/dplastico.github.io/main/_posts/img/2022-03-29-14-22-07.png)

 a cool function from x32dbg is to display the memory as graph, in the same way as IDA, if we click "g" on the screen it will display the memory as graph, let's give it a try and lets see if we can spot the call to WinMain

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dplastico/dplastico.github.io/main/_posts/img/2022-03-29-18-33-09.png)

Great, now let's follow that address on the call  (after the push 400000 value) and let's set a breakpoint using the "F2" key on the first instruction, it should turn red, as the image below
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dplastico/dplastico.github.io/main/_posts/img/2022-03-29-18-35-28.png)

Now we can press run and the execution will stop at our breakpoint. We will see a buffer being set with 0xF4 bytes size so this indicates that we land in the proper function, and we can also go to graph mode and look for the call to VirtualProtect instruction Lets set a breakpoint there


![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dplastico/dplastico.github.io/main/_posts/img/2022-03-29-18-39-17.png)

Now that we are in the break point let's take a look at the arguments being passed to the function

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dplastico/dplastico.github.io/main/_posts/img/2022-03-29-18-45-46.png)

After we hit the break point we see that x32dbg has renamed the offset of memory to VirtualProtect and at bottom right we can see the contents of the stack, so we can inspect the argument to the funcion

```c++
BOOL VirtualProtect(
  [in]  LPVOID lpAddress,
  [in]  SIZE_T dwSize,
  [in]  DWORD  flNewProtect,
  [out] PDWORD lpflOldProtect
);
```

We know the arguments of VirtualProtect form microsoft documentation, so from above and from the values on the stack in this example we can infer:

- 0x0085AFE8 will be the address from which *VirtualProtect* will change permissions
- 0x8700 will be the size of the memory space that will be affected
- 0x40 flag indicate that the permission will be set to  **PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE** according to the memory protection constant 
*https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/memory/memory-protection-constants*

The last argument is an address where the previous permissions flag will be written. If we right click over the first argument in ou case 0x0085AFE8 and press follow in memory map, we can check the permission are not set to execute


![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dplastico/dplastico.github.io/main/_posts/img/2022-03-29-18-55-48.png)

If we do the same, right click but this time we press follow in disassembler we will see that there's actual code on that region, so this confirms our static analysis that the program will change the permissions on this region in order to execute code on it.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dplastico/dplastico.github.io/main/_posts/img/2022-03-29-18-57-54.png)

Let's return to where our EIP is (you can double click on the EIP on the register section on x32dbg) and let's set a breakpoint on the next instruction after the call to VirtualProtect where we are pointing now, this should be the call to EBP-0x14

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dplastico/dplastico.github.io/main/_posts/img/2022-03-29-18-59-51.png)

Let's click run.


After hitting the breakpoint again, we can step into the function to see if we are direct into the code, we can do this with "F7" key or clicking on the "step into" icon

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dplastico/dplastico.github.io/main/_posts/img/2022-03-29-19-02-54.png)

Great, we can see  that the execution was properly redirected and that we are now going to execute code in this region, we can play along with the code (remember to be careful since we are working with malware so if something fails you should revert the vm). Also we can press on the "push ebp" instruction, right click and add as a function to better display information.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dplastico/dplastico.github.io/main/_posts/img/2022-03-29-19-35-52.png)

Let's set a breakpoint on the first function being called and then "step into" with the "F7" key. If we follow the coe will hit apoint where some values are pushed on the stack as the image below :
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dplastico/dplastico.github.io/main/_posts/img/2022-03-29-20-10-47.png)

This is a common obfuscation technique instead of writing the string the developer needs its build during execution. we can see the string being built by clicking "follow address in dump" to one of this values being pushed for example the one being pushed from ebp-0x28


![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dplastico/dplastico.github.io/main/_posts/img/2022-03-29-20-16-52.png)


Above we can see the string Kernel32.dll in UNICODE being constructed, so we assume that this will probably load some modules, let's execute this function until it returns by clicking on the up arrow in the menu

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dplastico/dplastico.github.io/main/_posts/img/2022-03-29-20-21-56.png)

Before we return we can see also that the string LoadLibraryA has been resolved so it will probably resolve APIs that the malware needs to start executing

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dplastico/dplastico.github.io/main/_posts/img/2022-03-29-20-48-02.png)

After return we can step through the code and see who various API are being resolved as the example for VirtualAlloc above. Now since we are resolving the API,  Let's see if we can find an interesting JMP to register or JMP to memory instruction that can lead us to where maybe The Original Entry Point for the malicious code is.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dplastico/dplastico.github.io/main/_posts/img/2022-03-29-20-51-45.png)

If we look at the image above we do find a JMP EAX, and it seems that the malware developer made some mistake and they leave a string that will be print to the debugger telling us that we will "JUMP to OEP), let's set a breakpoint in this JMP instruction and let's follow execution

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dplastico/dplastico.github.io/main/_posts/img/2022-03-29-20-56-11.png)

Above we can see that the jump took us to this code. We can assume it's our Original Entry Point (OEP), but right after the first call, we see an exit call, so let's step into the first function, that should be our OEP. 

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dplastico/dplastico.github.io/main/_posts/img/2022-03-30-16-19-33.png)

Above we can see the Original Entry Point, how do we know this? We can take a look at what compilers do for different languages and that way identify if it corresponds to an Entry Point. The best resource I found is this image from  a CLS tutorial (thanks to *@solid*) where you can see that the call to a jmp (like in our example) is common for Visual Studio. That's why we can observe that this is the Entry Point for the program.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dplastico/dplastico.github.io/main/_posts/img/2022-03-30-16-25-25.png)


With this information, let's try to extract it with Scylla again,

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dplastico/dplastico.github.io/main/_posts/img/2022-03-30-01-26-20.png)

As you can see above, After getting the IAT with IAT Autosearch and Getting the imports with Scylla, We got an error trying to import a module, we should remove this module if we want to dump the binary if not, and execute it, otherwise it will nor run, and only static analysis could be performed, We can do this by right clicking on the module and pressing "Delete Tree Node". And then dump , let's dump the file as "globelimposter_dump.exe"


![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dplastico/dplastico.github.io/main/_posts/img/2022-03-30-01-31-05.png)

Also as shown above, don't forget to "Fix Dump" the globelimposter_dump.exe, with this SYLLA  will create a file named : globelimposter_dump_SYC.exe, And we can open it on IDa and see that we analyze and perform static analysis on it as shown below

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dplastico/dplastico.github.io/main/_posts/img/2022-03-29-21-05-19.png)

Also we can run floss and direct the output to a text file, to see the strings from the dumped binary to start analyzing as show below

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dplastico/dplastico.github.io/main/_posts/img/2022-03-30-01-35-59.png)

Some registers and commands are populated, there could be still more obfuscation, but for now we can work on this binary to analyze more data and get new **IOC**, we successfully extract the packed executable. Also we can check if it's unpacked with a software like DetectitEasy, that will reveal that the compiler used was indeed Visual C/C++ as the next image displays
*https://github.com/horsicq/Detect-It-Easy*

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dplastico/dplastico.github.io/main/_posts/img/2022-03-31-13-51-31.png)

Now  to finalize let's run the unpacked version of the malware, to see if it will encrypt our files again. We can take a screenshot before the malware is executed, as shown below

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dplastico/dplastico.github.io/main/_posts/img/2022-03-30-01-39-08.png)

And another one after execution we can see the files on the desktop being renamed and encrypted again, on the image below:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dplastico/dplastico.github.io/main/_posts/img/2022-03-30-01-46-44.png)

Amazing, the unpacked version works flawlessly, We successfully unpacked the malware sample.

# Conclusion

Learning more deep into packers and  unpacking techniques was something that I have pending for a while on my TODO list. I have to admit that it's not my first time unpacking malware, I have some experience, but mostly I relied on tools to unpack it. This was a good learning experience since I can understand how the PE is constructed and this way build better tools or perform a better analysis on PE files. I have a Exploit Development background, I feel comfortable with debuggers and disassemblers, so much of the tools came handy to me, but also I learned some new tricks that I hope I was able to showcase to you.

I have to say that the File structure is something that really amazes me, and I would like to continue learning about this, maybe I will prepare a future post about the ELF format.

I Hope this post is useful to someone trying to learn about PE and packers.
